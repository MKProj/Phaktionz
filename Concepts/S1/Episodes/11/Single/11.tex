\par We get to see the new team that won the shop tourney, however Finn has a challenge for them, 
not only to build teamwork but understand each other better. The way he accomplishes this is by 
making each member swap with another one.

\paragraph{Original Decks}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Zane : Warrior’s Basic
   \item Lulo : United Army
   \item Khloe : Insect Manipulation
   \item Percy : Reinforced Elf Army
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Mixed Decks}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Zane : United Army
   \item Lulo : Insect Manipulation
   \item Khloe : Reinforced Elf Army
   \item Percy : Warriors Basic
\end{itemize}
\par We then get:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Zane VS Percy (Zane W)
   \item Khloe VS Lulo (Lulo W)
\end{itemize}
\par We see them struggling trying to understand each other decks, Finn tells them the importance of 
understanding each other’s decks, and as for the cities they need more practice.
